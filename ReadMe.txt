This is a small program called Link Crawl...basically you enter an url in the combo box and hit enter...wait for the progress bar to finish then hit the crawl button to gather all the links on the page...you can save them to a list with the save button or clear the list with the clear button...visit my website at http://tyrsoft.myip.org
